# Modern Rhetoric - an NLP approach

Project for Math/English 190S - Democracy, Game Theory, and Persuasion - at Duke University

## What did we do?

We used Aristotle's modes of persuasion and sentiment analysis within Tweets related to current politics in the United States to understand the use of rhetoric in a modern context.

Two sets of Tweets were analyzed for subjectivity and polarized language:
* Tweets published by Trump on his personal account and
* Tweets published by the general population about the Florida Midterm Elections.


## What did we find?

* We demonstrated the use of computer algorithms in natural language processing as effective in measuring elements of rhetoric.
* We quantified the high levels of rhetoric in modern politics by pairing it with Aristotleâ€™s modes of persuasion.
* We witnessed high levels of usage of pathos and ethos via emotional polarization and subjectivity to manipulate and convince voters.
